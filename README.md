# Sentinel-Core
Hello! This is my first coding project. 

Sentinel is a Flask Web Application aimed at helping users visualize their data on a geographic map. 
Utilising the Leaflet API, the programme takes in data from a database and iterates through it to create and plot its respective entries and markers on the interface. 

Program Features
- Allows users to create and delete their own data entries
- Allows users to upload appropriately formatted excel sheets read as a csv
- Allows for dynamic filtering of data based on entry attributes
- Allows for toggling of filter layers for markers and heatmap layers
- Allows wipe of database from the main interface
